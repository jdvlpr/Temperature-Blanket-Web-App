                  ðŸŽ‰ Temperature-blanket.com is reaching a new milestone! The
                  source code for this web app is now available on GitHub for
                  anyone to view or contribute to. Thanks for the fun journey
                  together so far! I hope open-sourcing this project will lead
                  to an even better crochet and knitting resource for
                  craftspeople everywhere.

              <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl">A Short History</h2>

              <p>
                From the beginning, the goal of temperature-blanket.com has been
                to provide free, useful tools for crocheters and knitters all
                around the world. Since 2020, the number of users, features, and
                improvement has grown; thousands of craftspeople have used this
                web app to help make their work easier. Feedback and support
                from people like you have been tremendously helpful in
                developing and maintaining the site. Thank you! During the past
                four years, I've enjoyed working on this project as a hobby;
                I've added new features, streamlined my own development process,
                made plenty of mistakes, and learned a lot! Now I believe the
                time is right to share the source code with the world.
              </p>

              <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl">Why Open Source?</h2>

              <blockquote class="blockquote">
                If you want to go fast, work alone. If you want to go far, work
                together.

                  <span class="font-bold">ðŸ‘¥ Collaboration:</span> By allowing other
                  people to contribute their ideas and improvements to this web app,
                  more craftspeople can have access to better tools for their projects.
                  Whether itâ€™s a new feature, an improvement to the user experience,
                  or something I havenâ€™t even thought of yetâ€”other developers can
                  now explore the source code and propose their updates to this web
                  app.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <span class="font-bold">ðŸ‘‹ Community:</span> Many people have already
                  contributed in some way to temperature-blanket.com through feedback,
                  support, and encouragement. I see open-sourcing this web app as
                  my way to give back. With the source code on GitHub, others can
                  learn from and participate in the community that makes this project
                  special.

                <li>
                  <span class="font-bold">ðŸ”„ Continuity:</span> By making this web
                  app open source, someone else could theoretically continue working
                  on it without me. I don't intend to stop developing temperature-blanket.com,
                  but open-sourcing it provides redundancy and allows for other developers
                  to better understand and recreate this project if they want. The
                  source code helps explain how this site is made so that even without
                  me, the tools and features can be recreated in some form.
