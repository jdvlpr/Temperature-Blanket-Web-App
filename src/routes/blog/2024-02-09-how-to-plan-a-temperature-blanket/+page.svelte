                  Hello! I'm Thomas (J), the developer of
                  temperature-blanket.com, and in this guide I'll walk you
                  through using the <a href="/" class="link">Project Planner</a>
                  tool on this site to hopefully remove some of the stress of starting
                  a new project. By the end, I hope you feel educated, equipped,
                  and excited to start creating!

                The Project: Blanket? Scarf? Socks?
              </h2>

              <p>
                Yes, it's called a temperature <span class="italic"
                  >blanket</span
                >, but have you considered making some other weather-based
                project? If a scarf, socks, shawl, or even a ssssnake sounds
                more doable to you, you're free to change your idea! Blankets
                are fantastic but can be a big commitment. Pick a project you're
                likely to finish. The
                <a href="/" class="link">Project Planner</a> was designed with blankets
                in mind, but it can help you plan other weather-inspired creations
                too.
              </p>

                    is the Project Planner. You'll see a bit of information at
                    the top about temperature blankets, and under that a section
                    called Location:

                  <p>
                    You can use the Project Planner on a mobile phone, tablet,
                    or bigger computer. I recommend using the largest screen
                    available to you.

                  <p>
                    No. And Yes. The website is the app. It's not in the Apple
                    or Google app store, but you can

                Enter a city, region, or landmark, and select a result from the
                list. Great job! You're now able to press that Search button and
                get weather data.
              </p>

              <h2

                The Time: This Year? Last Year? 50 Years Ago?
              </h2>

              <p>
                Wait! Before you search for weather, notice the Year, Month, and
                Day options. The default is January 1st, last year.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, you may want to make a project using this year's weather
                data, so you change the year to this year. Right? Well, you are
                free to do that, but I recommend a different approach.
              </p>
              <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4">
                <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col gap-4">
                  <p>
                    I recommend selecting last year or an older yearâ€”at least in
                    the beginning when you're planning your project. Here's why:
                    all the weather data for this year isn't available yet, so
                    you won't be able to fully take advantage of the Project
                    Planner if you change the date to this year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you do want this year's weather data, you can always come
                    back and change the date after going through the other
                    sections of the Project Planner. All your color and pattern
                    settings are saved even if you change the date later and
                    search for new weather.

                    It depends on the location. For some places, the oldest
                    available weather data is about 1940.

                    I've tried to find the highest quality and most
                    cost-effective weather sources. The data comes from
                    <a
                      href="https://open-meteo.com"
                      class="link"
                      target="_blank">Open-Meteo</a
                    >
                    and
                    <a href="https://meteostat.net" class="link" target="_blank"
                      >Meteostat</a
                    >, and they obtain their information from a variety of open
                    sources. There is sometimes a delay of about a week for
                    recent weather data, so if something seems off, check back
                    in a few days.
                  </p>
                  <div class="my-4"></div>
                </div>
              </div>

              <p>
                You can investigate the weather info as much or as little as you
                like. The highest and lowest temperature at the top can be
                useful to keep in mind when you make your ranges. The data here
                is what the Project Planner uses to generate automatic ranges
                and a preview of your project.

                The Yarn: Colors Galore
              </h2>
              <p>
                There's a lot to cover in this section, but bear with me. If you
                haven't already, go ahead and press the Colors button at the
                bottom of the Project Planner.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're just getting started and don't know where to begin,
                here's a helpful order of operation:
              </p>
              <div class="ml-4">
                <p>
                  1. Choose <span class="font-bold">how many</span> colors you want.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. Pick <span class="font-bold">which</span> colors you want.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. Assign <span class="font-bold">ranges</span> to each color.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                I'll start with the first two: <span class="font-bold"
                  >how many</span
                >
                and
                <span class="font-bold">which</span> colors to use. A typical project
                uses between 7 and 15 colors (from now on I'll call them colorways,
                since we're talking about yarn). But you are free to use more or
                less colorways if you want. In the Project Planner, there are several
                ways you can pick colorways:
              </p>
              <div class="ml-4">
                <p>
                  <span class="font-bold">All at once</span> - use the tools in the
                  toolbar to choose how many and which colorways to use.

              </div>
              <p>
                I recommend starting with one of the all-at-once tools, and then
                editing colorways one by one as needed. For example, use the
                Browse Palette tool to pick a pre-made colorway combination, and
                then change one or two colors to fit your liking. Or pick all
                your colorways from scratch by using the Choose Colorways tool,
                and then later you can edit individual colorways if you want.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are no right or wrong color choices, but here are some
                general guidelines:
              </p>
              <div class="ml-4">
                <p>
                  - Choose a brand of yarn first to help narrow down the
                  available colorway choices. You'll probably want to use the
                  same or similar yarn for all your colorways.
                </p>
                <p>
                  - Organize the colorways in some way. ROYGBIV (the order of
                  the rainbow) is a good place to start, but you could try
                  lightest-to-darkest, similar hues together, or based on one of
                  the combinations from the <a
                    href="https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/"

                    class="link">color wheel</a
                  >.
                </p>
                <p>
                  - Visit the <a href="/gallery" class="link">project gallery</a
                  > for ideas an inspiration.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div
                class="variant-outline-primary p-4 rounded-container-token w-fit"
              >
                <p class="font-bold">ðŸ’¡ Handy Hints</p>
                <div class="ml-4">
                  <div>
                    <p>
                      - If you know which brand and yarn you'll use, set it as
                      the default yarn when you're choosing colorways. Now that
                      yarn will be automatically selected when you open other
                      tools in the Project Planner.
                    </p>
                    <img
                      class="max-w-64 w-full h-auto max-h-fit"

                  </div>
                  <p>
                    - A good-looking color palette is nice, but don't get too
                    attached. You may decide to change some colorways after
                    seeing the preview of your project. That's ok! Hold your
                    colorway choices loosely until you're ready to start working
                    on your project.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>

              <p>
                Now for the last step regarding your colorways: <span
                  class="font-bold">assigning ranges</span
                >. As you may know, each colorway needs to have an assigned a
                temperature range. That'll determine which colorway is used on
                which day of your project, based on the weather for that day.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Project Planner tries to help you assign ranges by
                generating automatic ranges, and letting you adjust each range
                if you want. Press the Customize Ranges button to get started.
              </p>
              <img
                class="w-full h-auto max-h-fit"

                alt="Ranges Configuration"
              />
              <p>
                On the right inside each colorway are little groups of numbers.
                Keep an eye on those if you adjust range settings. Those numbers
                can help you gauge relatively how much of each yarn colorway
                you'll need for your project.
              </p>

              <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4">
                <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col gap-4">
                  <p>
                    By default, the Project Planner assumes a couple things, but
                    you can change these if you want:
                  </p>

                  <div class="ml-4">
                    <p>
                      - It assumes you want to use each colorway about the same
                      number of times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      - And it assumes you want to use the daily high
                      temperatures for your project.

                  </div>

                  <p>
                    Want to instead use the daily low temperatures? Or want each
                    range to be the same (for example 5 or 10 degree increments
                    for each colorway)? Change those settings in the Setup
                    Ranges section.
                  </p>
                </div>

                    <span class="italic">Why do the ranges repeat values?</span>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By default, a colorway's To value is the same as the next
                    colorway's From value. This is because a temperature counts
                    as inside a range if it is
                    <span class="italic">greater than-or-equal</span>
                    to the From value and
                    <span class="italic">less-than-and-not-equal-to</span>
                    the To value. If those numbers didn't repeat, a temperature that
                    falls in between wouldn't be in any range. If you want more details,

                How you adjust the ranges will affect what your project preview
                looks like. Don't worry, you don't have to finalize all your
                ranges right now. You can always come back to the Colors section

                    Seeing and adjusting the preview can help you make decisions
                    before you start your project. You may decide you want to
                    use different yarn colorways, or you may decide you want to
                    record the daily low instead of the daily high temperature.
                    You may want to go back to the Colors section and adjust the
                    ranges. Go ahead! Nobody is stopping you.

                    Have fun exploring and customizing your project. You can
                    jump between the Colors section and the Preview section to
                    see how tweaking the colorways and ranges changes the
                    preview.

                    The Project Planner doesn't give you a specific pattern to
                    follow. You can search the internet to find that elsewhere.
                    Instead the preview is meant to give you a general idea of
                    what your project could look like, and to help you decide
                    which colorways and ranges to use.

                When you're happy with the colorway and layout choices, you're
                ready to start making your project! Gather your yarn and get
                creating! It's always a good idea to make a test swatch to see
                if you want to adjust the size or dimensions of your project.

                    to follow along with as you make your project. It contains a
                    temperature gauge with your colorways and ranges, the daily weather
                    data, and it tells you which colorways to use on which days.

                Well, that's it! I hope you have a better understanding of how
                to plan a temperature blanket using the Project Planner on
                temperature-blanket.com. And I hope it takes some of the stress
                out of thinking about starting your project.
